Looking back at my college life, I sincerely regret disrespecting my time. Sure, people say I'm doing great relative to others, and that isn't entirely false. I barely remember a handful of instances where I truly "worked hard". 

Anyway, this project is an attempt to realise how valuable the thousands of hours I wasted were. I'm going to pick a project and spend 100 hours on it. This includes planning, learning relevant skills and creating the entire thing. For this, I'd need a way to track the time I'm spending on it. My iPhone allows me to time a maximum of 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. I can work with that for now, but since I deserve only the best I've decided that my first project is going to be a fancy ass 100 hour timer! More about that [here](https://j031m.github.io/posts/Evolution-Simulator).

I might as well link all projects here.
