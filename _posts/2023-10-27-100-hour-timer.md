Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the first project in my 100 Hour Project series: A Hundred Hour Timer!

## Features
- can track 100 hours, obviously persistent between sessions
- has fancy animations that change with 100 hours
- has an hourly update feature
- maintains an archive of all the past projects
- (optional) cross platform with cloud syncing

For the fancy animations, I've settled on an evolution simulation, complete with organisms controlled by neural networks that can evolve over generations. This part of the timer is insipred by [the bibites](https://www.thebibites.com/).
I see myself spending a lot of time getting this to work, considering I have no exprience with Unity, which is presumably what I'm going to be using to implement this "timer".
