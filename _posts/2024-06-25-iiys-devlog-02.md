Yesterday was a day off. It was unintentional but according to this one video CGPgrey made, taking an off on wednesday and sunday is more effective than the standard saturday sunday weekend. Still experimenting with the idea though. I haven't really thought of what I want to do today, there seem to be many things I need to do and it's getting hard for me to keep track of everything. So for today I've decided to take small strides towards iiys. I've noticed that when it comes to mammoth tasks like this, the easiest way to draw out motivation when I'm feeling lost is to come up with really precise next steps. Right now it's to figure out what APIs I'll need for the most basic implementation. I'm assuming API calls from my local machine will suffice. Those APIs would include gemini, a vector database, a transformer embedder.

I realise that this reads more like a diary entry than a serious devlog that discusses only the project relevant bits, I've yet to find the kind of blogs I wish to write, for now, I won't discount anything. Let today be a diary, who knows what tomorrow will be. I want to say with confidence that tomorrow definitely will be something. Anyway that's enough rambling, let's start searching.

It would seem I was charged 72 paise for something, I'm guessing it was because I saved some prompts and the storage costed. Hopefully it isn't because I used gemini, coz that was supposed to be free according to [this](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)
